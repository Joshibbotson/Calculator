Thus far i've overcome issues with how to retrieve button ID's to multiple buttons in a less verbose way. In my commit history you'll notice that early on I was using ten addEventListeners written line by line for buttons 0-9, I then implemented a while loop to retrieve the ID's, and eventually settled with a for each loop instead to more efficient.

This calculator also makes use of array sorting methods such as .map() and .push()
